Documentation sections:

* Scalable: Redis is a shared storage layer, thus Kubernetes can scale up/down pods (SCALABLE) without
losing track of running workflows.


* Stateless: Each pod/container can read/write task statuses to Redis without relying on local memory.

* No input validation checks

* Can abstract the persistant storage layer, so that Redis can be replaced with any other implemenation
seamlessly.

Questions for Baruch:

1. Can you give an ABSTRACT example of how the engine will be called/used? I need an example of calls
(doesn't matter the input JSON structure for now)

2. I can't use Redis locally. Can you give me a concrete example
of how Redis can be used/called in the final environment where the code will run?
